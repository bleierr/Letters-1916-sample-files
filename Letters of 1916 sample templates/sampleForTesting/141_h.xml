        <note type="summary">
            <p>Diarmid Coffey (1888-1964) joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and became secretary of the Irish National Volunteers after the organisation split in 1915 (it was the other group who participated in the Rising). He later served as assistant clerk of the Seanad.</p>
            <p>Jane Coffey (née l&#39;Estrange) (1857-1921) was born into a Protestant family but married Catholic George Coffey and became a member of the National Literary Society.</p>
            <p>The letter is to Diarmid from his mother and refers to a planned trip to London adding that she is glad not to have to travel to Wales instead. She does, however, also note that England is &#39;unpleasant&#39; for an Irish Irelander (a cultural nationalist) just now.</p>
