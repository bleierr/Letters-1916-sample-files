        <note type="summary">
            <p>This letter was written to Seamus Fitzgerald (1896–1972). Fitzgerald, a Cork politician who channeled his patriotism into day to day efforts to establish Ireland as a modern nation. Fitzgerald joined the Irish Volunteers and Sinn Féin after Easter Week 1916, he was then arrested and sent to Frongoch, Wales, one of the seven places in which he was interned in subsequent years.</p>
            <p>This is an emotive letter to Seamus from his mother Alice counselling him to keep his spirits up for fear &#34;you will make me worse than what I am&#34;. She hopes his friends will be sent to the same place so they could be company for him. His father has not been told of Seamus&#39; arrest &#34;God is good and Blessed Mother you may be home before him yet&#34;.</p>
