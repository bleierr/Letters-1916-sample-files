        <note type="summary">
            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>
            <p>This letter to his mother recounts a recent illness. He writes of Dermot Neill, his Adjutant, whom he writes is &#39;splendid&#39;. He also writes of a strong rumor of a move to the trenches at an early date. He asks his mother to instruct Furey on the correct address for parcels as they are going astray.</p>
