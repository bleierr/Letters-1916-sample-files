        <note type="summary">
            <p>This letter was written by Joseph Dowdall (b.1865), an electrician living in Dublin city. The letter was addressed to Augustine Birrell. Birrell (1850-1933) was the chief secretary for Ireland from 1907 until his retirement in 1916 following the aftermath of the Easter Rising, for which Birrell accepted responsibility.</p>
            <p>In the letter Dowdall claims that he is being followed by two German spies. He reports that both are &#39;aliens&#39; but refuse to acknowledge their nationality. He believes the to men are reporting back to the German government in Dublin, London and the Continent. Dowdall writes that he will be willing to make a full statement about the men should Birrell consider it prudent to investigate.</p>
