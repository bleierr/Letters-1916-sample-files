        <note type="summary">
            <p>This was the last written letter of Cornelius (&#39;Con&#39;) Colbert (1888 - 1916). Mobilized on 24 April 1916 Colbert fought for the duration of the Rising until his open surrender on 30 April. Despite his marginal role in the fighting he was designated for severe treatment owing to his pre-rising activities and connection with Pearse. He was shot by firing squad in Kilmainham jail on 8 May and buried in the common grave in Arbour Hill jail. Aged twenty-seven, Colbert was among the youngest of the insurgent leaders to be executed. Owing to his youth and relatively junior rank, his execution was one of the most shocking to public opinion.</p>
            <p>This letter was sent to Colbert&#39;s sister Elizabeth, &#39;Lila&#39; (1888 - 1974). After the Rising Elizabeth served on the committee of the Irish Volunteers Dependentsâ€™ Fund. </p>
            <p>In this letter, Colbert explains that he did not want his sister to visit him before his execution as &#39;it would grieve us both too much&#39;. Colbert asks his sister to pray for him and hopes that he can &#39;die well&#39;.</p>

<p>I did not like to call you to this gaol <lb/> 
    to see me before I left this world, because I felt it would <lb/> 
    grieve us both too much, so I am just dropping you a <lb/> 
    line to ask you to forgive me anything I do love you and to <lb/> 
    say goodbye to you &amp; all my friends &amp; to get you &amp; them to <lb/> 
    say a prayer for my soul. Perhaps I'd never get the chance <lb/> 
    knowing when I was to die again and so I'll try &amp; die <lb/> 
    well. I received this morning, &amp; hope to do so again before <lb/> 
    I die. Pray for me, ask Fr. Devine &amp; Fr. Healy &amp; Fr. O'Brien <lb/> 
    to say a Mass for me also any priests you know. May God <lb/> 
    Help us all to die well &#x2014; you to bear your sorrow.</p>

    <salute>From Your loving Brother </salute>

                <note>I sent you a prayer book as tolken <lb/>
