                    <p>The letter is from Joseph MacDonagh to his sister Mary MacDonagh.</p>
                    <p>The letter offers condolences after the execution of their brother Thomas
                        MacDonagh in Kilmainham Gaol for his part in the Easter Rising (3 May).
                        Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916) was a poet and teacher. A leading member of the
                        Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, he was one of the principle
                        organisers of the Easter Rising and one of the seven signatories of the
                        Proclamation of the Irish Republic.</p>
                    <p>Joseph MacDonagh (1883-1922) was the youngest brother and went on to serve in
                        the First and Second DÃ¡ils and opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Mary
                        Josephine MacDonagh (1872-1954) was the eldest sibling. She went on to
                        become a nun with the Sisters of Charity.</p>
                    <p>She was the only member of the family to visit Thomas before his execution.
                        'Muriel' in the letter is Thomas MacDonagh's wife (1884-1917) and 'Jack' is
                        Thomas's brother John (1880-1961) who had fought under Thomas in the Rising
                        and was imprisoned afterwards.</p>
