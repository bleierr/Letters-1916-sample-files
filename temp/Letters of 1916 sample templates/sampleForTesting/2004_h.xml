        <note type="summary">
            <p>This letter is part of a rich correspondence between various members of the Duffin family, a large prosperous family living in Strandtown, Belfast. Several family members served in the war, including Major Terence Duffin, who served as a staff officer with 107 Brigade, and later with Royal Irish Rifles; Major Charles G Duffin MC, Royal Field Artillery; and their sisters Emma, Celia and Dorothy who served as Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADS) in Egypt and France, and with theYMCA.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA; In this four page letter, Helen Duffin (b.1891) is writing to her sister Celia who is ill and who cannot be with the family for Christmas. Helen tells Celia about an &#34;odd&#34; incident she has had with an unexpected visitor to her office: a little man with a &#34;pale face&#34; and a &#34;fuz of red hair&#34; who is looking for some contributions to a poetry book for which Lavery (possibly John Lavery, the painter) is also providing a drawing. The man has requested that Celia provide a poem for the volume and their sister Ruth is also sending him one. Helen concludes the letter and encloses a humorous sketch.</p>

                    wild &#x2014; why do you grip me so much <lb/> 
                    &amp; why are my thoughts so cluttered around <lb/>

                    sympathy, my work is so hard, and difficulties <lb/> 
                    so many &#x2014; but of course if I had you here to <lb/> 
                    tell all my worries to, things would run <lb/> 
                    smoothly &#x2014; I trust you and all at home </p><pb/>
