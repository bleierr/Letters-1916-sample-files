        <note type="summary">
            <p>This letter is part of a rich correspondence between various members of the Duffin family, a large prosperous family living in Strandtown, Belfast. Several family members served in the war, including Major Terence Duffin, who served as a staff officer with 107 Brigade, and later with Royal Irish Rifles; Major Charles G Duffin MC, Royal Field Artillery; and their sisters Emma, Celia and Dorothy who served as Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADS) in Egypt and France, and with theYMCA.</p>
            <p>In this four page letter, Helen Duffin (b.1891) is writing to her sister Celia who is ill and who cannot be with the family for Christmas. Helen tells Celia about an &#34;odd&#34; incident she had with an unexpected visitor to her office: a little man with a &#34;pale face&#34; and a &#34;fuz of red hair&#34; who is looking for some contributions to a poetry book for which Lavery (possibly John Lavery, the painter) is also providing a drawing. The man has requested that Celia provide a poem for the volume and their sister Ruth is also sending him one. At the end of the letter Helen encloses a humorous sketch.</p>

                       asked if I would see Mr.<lb/>
