            <p>This is a letter from Patrick Pearse (1879-1916), writer, educationalist and revolutionary, to Seán Thomas O&#39;Kelly (1182-1966), politician and later president of Ireland. Pearse was a leading member of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He was one of the leaders of the Easter Rising, a signatory of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, commander in chief of the rebel forces and declared president of the Provisional Government on the outbreak of the Rising. He was executed for his part in the Rising on 3 May 1916.</p>
            <p>O&#39;Kelly was a founder member of Sinn Féin and joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) in 1901 and served as aide-de-camp to Pearse duirng the Rising.</p>
            <p>In this letter, written two days before the Easter Rising and on the eve of the original date for the Rising, Pearse asks if O&#39;Kelly can provide accommodation for the night for himself and his brother William (1881-1916), who was also later executed.</p>

                    by bearer. We should send some traps in <lb/>
