                    <p>Letter from Lady Clonbrock (Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton), wife of Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock) to Mrs Budson requesting help in the creation of sub-centres in County Galway for the collection of moss for surgical dressings. The moss was to be used for the treatment of soldiers wounded while fighting with the British army during World War I. The Irish War Hospital Supply had requested that the collection of moss was to be increased to meet higher demand and Lady Clonbrock was put in charge of the collection in Galway.</p>
                    <p>Lady Clonbrock was a member of the Irish Women’s Association and heavily involved in assisting Irish soldiers during World War I.</p>

                    <salute>Dear Mrs. Budson &#x2014;</salute>
                </opener>

<p>The Secretary of "The Irish War Hospital Supply, Royal College<lb/> 
of ScienceSub-Depot" informs me that "the demand for Moss Dressings<lb/>
has increased with such unexpected rapidity that it is absolutely<lb/> 
essential to organize the collection of Sphagnum Moss on a much<lb/> 
larger scale than we have done up to the present." The Director<lb/> 
General of Voluntary Organizations&#x2014;-Sir Edward Ward-suggests that<lb/> 
a few main Centres should be formed in Ireland, and I have been<lb/> 
asked to form one in this County. I trust I may count on your help,<lb/> 
for I am anxious to make our County Collection a great success.<lb/> 
Lady Mahon has consented to act as Secretary. I suggest that you<lb/> 
should consider yourself a Sub-Centre, and that you endeavour to<lb/> 
interest your neighbourhood&#x2014;-school children and others&#x2014;-to take the<lb/> 
Sphagnum Moss to you regularly, and at regular convenient intervals,<lb/> 
once a fortnight, if possible, you send your collection, carefully<lb/> 
hand picked and "bone dry", by post or rail, addressed to The Hon:<lb/>
Lady Mahon, Castlegar, Ballinasloe. I shall glad to be know, by return of post,<lb/> 
if you will undertake this important War work, and if so if you will<lb/>
 start it immediately.</p><lb/>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Your's Sincerely<lb/> 
                    <hi rend="underline">Augusta Clonbrock</hi></salute>
                </closer>

<note>I hope you will enter into this work and arrange with your neighbours, or are there any you would wish me to write to<hi rend="underline">?</hi> Eyre? or Mavis (?).&#x2014;</note>
